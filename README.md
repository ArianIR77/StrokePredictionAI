# Stroke Prediction AI

## Overview
This project is focused on developing an AI-driven solution for predicting the risk of stroke in patients. Leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, this project aims to analyze health data to assist healthcare professionals in early stroke detection and intervention. The model considers various factors such as age, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle attributes.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses machine learning to predict stroke risk.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes exploratory data analysis with visualizations of key health parameters.
- **Multiple Models**: Implements several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask application to interact with the model through a user-friendly interface.

## Data
The dataset includes attributes such as patient age, gender, medical history (hypertension, heart disease), lifestyle information (smoking status, work type), and health metrics (BMI, average glucose level). The target variable is stroke occurrence.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **Flask**: For creating the web application.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Joblib**: For model persistence.
